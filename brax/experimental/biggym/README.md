# BIG-Gym

BIG-Gym is a *crowd-sourcing* challenge for RL *environments* and *behaviors*, inspired by [BIG-Bench](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench). It is co-organized as part of NeurIPS 2021 [Ecology Theory for RL (EcoRL)](https://sites.google.com/view/ecorl2021/home) workshop. *Our goal is to create the "ImageNet" for continuous control, with diversity in agent morphologies, environment scenes, objects, and tasks.* We solicit submissions for two tracks: **Open-Ended Creativity Track** and **Goal-Oriented Competition Track**.
